# EnsembleModel
本集成模型由江西理工大学与北京师范大学联合设计。

该项目为论文《Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for real-time gravitational wave signal recognition》实验中集成模型的构造代码。

项目不仅公开了模型构造代码，还公开了论文中集成模型中所有的基模型的权重和16s的O1、O2事件的白化应变信号。研究者可以根据以上数据，直接运行model1Detect、model2Detect、model3Detect、来复现论文中16s的探测结果。

研究者还可以根据以上代码构建自己的集成模型对引力波进行探测。

The ensemble model is designed by the joint efforts of Jiangxi University of Science and Technology and Beijing Normal University.

This project is the construction code of the ensemble model in the paper 'Ensemble of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for real-time gravitational wave signal recognition'

The project not only exposes the model construction code, but also the weights of all the base learners in the ensemble model and the whitening 16s strain of O1 and O2 events in the paper. Based on the above data, researchers can directly run model1Detect, model2Detect, model3Detect to reproduce the 16S detection results in the paper.

Researchers can also build their own ensemble models to detect gravitational waves from the above code.
